Wireshark Dissector Plugin for DLEP
===================================

Wireshark dissector plugin for the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol ([DLEP][dlep]).

Installation
------------

The following instructions are tailored and tested for Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit Desktop and Wireshark 2.6.8:

* Install wireshark, install wireshark dependencies, download wireshark source code, and extract the DLEP plugin:

      ```bash
      cd ~/Downloads
      sudo apt-get install wireshark
      sudo apt-get build-dep wireshark
      apt-get source wireshark
      tar -zxf /path/to/dissector/tarball/dlep-wireshark-dissector-1.0.0.tgz -C ~/Downloads/wireshark-2.6.8/plugins/epan/dlep --strip-components=1
      ```

* Make and install the plugin:

      ```bash
      cd ~/Downloads/wireshark-2.6.8
      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake -DCUSTOM_PLUGIN_SRC_DIR="plugins/epan/dlep" ../
      make -j8 -C plugins/epan/dlep
      mkdir -p ~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins/2.6/epan
      cp run/plugins/2.6/epan/dlep.so ~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins/2.6/epan/
      ```

Usage
-----

* Verify installation by confirming that the plugin is listed in the following Wireshark menu:

        Help -> About Wireshark -> Plugins

* Open up a sample capture file:

        wireshark plugins/epan/dlep/test/capture1.pcapng

* There are two preferences that adjust the TCP port and UDP port associated with DLEP packets.
  User preferences for this plugin may be set in the following menu:

        Edit -> Preferences... -> Protocols -> DLEP

Testing
-------

Sample DLEP capture files and a README are located in ```dlep/test```.
The capture files may be opened in Wireshark as an example capture or used for fuzz-testing the plugin.

Caveats / Future Work
---------------------

* This dissector plugin adheres to [RFC 8175][rfc8175].
* This plugin attempts to decode all Data Items within a DLEP Signal or Message. While unrecognized Data Items are reported as such, invalid or disallowed duplicate Data Items are not indicated (Section 12.1 of [RFC 8175][rfc8175]).
* This plugin does not dissect Data Items belonging to DLEP extensions -- such Data Items are marked as "Unknown".
* While DLEP TCP/UDP ports are configurable via user preferences, this plugin does not dynamically register ports provided by IPv4/6 Connection Point Data Items.
* This plugin does not perform TCP segment reassembly. DLEP messages are assumed to not exceed the MTU of the link between a modem and router participating in the DLEP Session.
