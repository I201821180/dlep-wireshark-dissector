Wireshark Dissector Plugin for DLEP
===================================

Wireshark dissector plugin for the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol ([DLEP][dlep]).

Installation
------------

The following installation instructions are tailored for Ubuntu and have been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit Desktop with Wireshark version 1.10.6 downloaded using the APT package manager.

* Install wireshark, install wireshark dependencies, download wireshark source code, and extract the DLEP plugin:

        cd ~/Downloads
        sudo apt-get install wireshark
        sudo apt-get build-dep wireshark
        apt-get source wireshark
        tar -zxf /path/to/dissector/tarball/dlep-wireshark-dissector-0.0.1.tgz -C ~/Downloads/wireshark-1.10.6/plugins --strip-components=1

* Make and install the plugin:

        cd ~/Downloads/wireshark-1.10.6
        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure --with-gtk3=yes
        make -C plugins/dlep
        mkdir -p ~/.wireshark/plugins
        cp plugins/dlep/.libs/dlep.so ~/.wireshark/plugins/

  Note, without the flag `--with-gtk3=yes`, `./configure` failed to complete.

Usage
-----

* Verify installation by confirming that the plugin is listed in the following Wireshark menu:

        Help -> About Wireshark -> Plugins

* Open up a sample capture file:

        wireshark plugins/dlep/test/capture1.pcapng

* There are two preferences that adjust the TCP port and UDP port associated with DLEP packets. 
  User preferences for this plugin may be set in the following menu:

        Edit -> Preferences... -> Protocols -> DLEP

Testing
-------

Sample DLEP capture files and a README are located in ```dlep/test```.
The capture files may be opened in Wireshark as an example capture or used for fuzz-testing the plugin.

Caveats / Future Work
---------------------

* This plugin adheres to version 24 of the [DLEP Internet Draft][dlep24].
* This plugin attempts to decode all Data Items within a DLEP Signal or Message. While unrecognized Data Items are reported as such, invalid or disallowed duplicate Data Items are not indicated (Section 10.1 of [DLEP Internet Draft][dlep24]).
* This plugin does not dissect Data Items belonging to DLEP extensions, (e.g., [Credit Windowing][dlep-ext-cw]); such Data Items are marked as unknown.
* While DLEP TCP/UDP ports are configurable via user preferences, this plugin does not dynamically register ports provided by IPv4/6 Connection Point Data Items.
* This plugin does not perform TCP segment reassembly -- it assumes DLEP messages do not exceed the MTU of the link between a modem and router participating DLEP Session.
